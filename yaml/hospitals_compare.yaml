  description: <p>Hospital Compare is an initiative conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  Medicare.gov states that the intent of the data is to help improve the quality of care at hospitals by distributing objective easy to understand data on hospital performance.  Hospitals are rated in numerous measurement categories including a survey of patient experiences and outcome results concerning readmissions and deaths.  The measurement period for each category spans 1 - 3 years starting in 2009 and carries into the present. Two of the most important measurement categories are mortality and readmission rates for treatment of heart attack and heart failure. Readmissions represent patients who had to return to the hospital within 30 days of dishcharge. A higher rate means more readmissions or fatalities and lower quality care.  A lower rate for each means better care.  Use the table below to search for your hospital or visit <a href="data.medicare.gov">data.medicare.gov</a> to explore all measurement categories.</p>
