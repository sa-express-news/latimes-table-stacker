  description: <p class="description-above-map">The map and table reflect a comparison of museums and libraries to gun retailers in Texas, broken down by counties. <b>Red indicates more gun stores, blue indicates more libraries and museums</b>. Gun retailer counts are based on ATF licenses and include traditional gun stores, as well as sporting retailers that sell guns such as Wal-Mart, pawn shops and individual retailers. Negative ratios (represented by red in the map) indicate more gun retailers than libraries and museums and positive ratios (indicated by blue in the map) indicate more libraries and museums. Counties with either no gun stores or no museums and libraries have a value 10 or -10. The museum-library to gun store ratios are based on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/17/where-gun-stores-outnumber-museums-and-libraries/" target="_blank">reporting by Christopher Ingraham of the Washington Post.</a> <b>Texas has a total of 5,680 licensed gun retailers and 2,906 museums and libraries.</b></p><div class="embedded-fusion-map"><iframe width="950" height="500" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col4%3E%3E1+from+1J6h-2h4cumKL10qD8LiEG18o5pLP7CFCqReE1mlQ&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=31.52287031332891&amp;lng=-99.86964453124995&amp;t=1&amp;z=5&amp;l=col4%3E%3E1&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=KML"></iframe></div>
