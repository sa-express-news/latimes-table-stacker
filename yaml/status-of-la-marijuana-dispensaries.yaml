  description: "<p>The Los Angeles city attorneyâ€™s office has warned more than 200 medical marijuana dispensaries to shut down immediately or face legal action. The warnings began with letters sent to 141 dispensaries on March 7 and another 60 on March 23. Dispensaries targeted include those that did not register to participate in a lottery &mdash; not yet scheduled &mdash; that will select 100 collectives to operate in the city. Operators of 231 dispensaries have applied to be included in the drawing.</p><p>The list below includes both dispensaries ordered to close, and those vying to stay open by participating in the lottery.</p>"
